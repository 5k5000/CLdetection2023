# RTMPose-Deploy

[中文说明](./README_CN.md)

RTMPose-Deploy is a C ++ code example that does **NOT** use MMDEPLOY for RTMPose localized deployment.

At present, RTMPose-Deploy has completed the deployment of RTMDetnano and RTMPose on the Windows system. This example only contains the source code. If you want a complete project example, please refer to:[https://github.com/HW140701/RTMPose-Deploy](https://github.com/HW140701/RTMPose-Deploy) . This project provides a complete VS2019 project and release package.

Subsequent will consider adding the use of C ++ Tensorrt SDK on the Windows system to deploy RTMDet-nano and RTMPose.
